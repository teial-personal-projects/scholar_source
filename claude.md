# Claude Development Guidelines

## React Best practices

Use this as a checklist / rubric that Claude should adhere to when generating or refactoring React code.

---

## Core React patterns

- Prefer **functional** components and Hooks; treat class components as legacy unless integrating with old code.[1][2]
- Keep components small, focused, and single‑responsibility; if a component grows beyond ~150–200 lines or handles several concerns, split it.[3][1]
- Co-locate logic with the component that owns it (state, derived data, effects, queries) instead of scattering utilities and hooks across the app.[4][2]
- Use composition over inheritance: accept children/slots instead of deeply nested prop options or config objects.[5][3]
- Use controlled components for form elements whenever you need validation, instant feedback, or complex interactions; otherwise consider uncontrolled refs for simple cases.[2][5]

***

## State and data fetching

- Keep state as **local** as possible; lift state only when multiple components truly share it.[4][2]
- Avoid prop drilling across many levels; use Context for cross-cutting concerns and consider a lightweight state library (Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit) for complex global state.[6][2]
- Store the minimal state needed; derive everything else from props or existing state instead of duplicating values.[7][5]
- Treat server as the source of truth for server data and client state as a cache or view model.[8][4]
- Use a dedicated data-fetching library (TanStack Query / React Query or SWR) instead of ad‑hoc useEffect + fetch for anything beyond trivial requests.[1][4]
- Normalize async flows: handle loading, error, empty, and success states explicitly and consistently.[2][1]

***

## React 18 features and concurrency

- Use Suspense for data fetching and code-splitting boundaries to improve perceived loading and structure async flows.[7][1]
- Use concurrent APIs like useTransition and useDeferredValue to keep the UI responsive during expensive updates or filtering.[9][7]
- Design UI so that non‑critical parts can be deferred or streamed rather than blocking the initial render.[1][7]

***

## React Server Components (RSC) and server/client split

(For Next.js App Router or other RSC-enabled setups.)

- Default to Server Components for data fetching, heavy computation, and non‑interactive UI to reduce client bundle size.[10][8]
- Keep Server Components stateless and side‑effect free; do not use client-only hooks (useState, useEffect, browser APIs) in them.[11][8]
- Use Client Components only when interactivity or browser APIs are required, and keep them as small and focused as possible.[12][8]
- Pay attention to boundaries: pass data from Server to Client via props, avoid leaking client concerns into server code.[13][8]
- Be cautious with third‑party libraries in Server Components; only use libraries that are safe on the server (no window/document/localStorage).[8][12]

***

## Performance and rendering

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders:
  - Use React.memo for pure presentational components with stable props.[2][1]
  - Use useCallback and useMemo for expensive computations or when prop identity matters (e.g., passed to memoized children).[7][1]
- Avoid inline anonymous functions and object/array literals in hot rendering paths when they cause prop identity churn.[14][7]
- Use stable, unique keys for list items; never use array index as key when list can be reordered or filtered.[15][7]
- Virtualize large lists and tables to avoid rendering hundreds/thousands of DOM nodes.[14][7]
- Avoid overusing Context; large or frequently changing contexts can trigger expensive tree-wide re-renders—consider splitting context or using selectors/state libraries.[6][7]
- Split bundles using dynamic import and React.lazy for heavy, rarely used routes or components.[15][2]
- Regularly profile the app (React DevTools Profiler, Web Vitals, browser performance tools) and optimize based on real bottlenecks, not guesses.[2][7]

***

## Structure, organization, and reuse

- Organize files by feature/module instead of strictly by type; keep components, hooks, and tests for a feature together.[1][2]
- Extract reusable UI patterns as shared components and shared hooks (e.g., useForm, useModal, useFetch) to avoid duplication.[1][2]
- Keep hooks pure: avoid doing non‑React side effects directly in custom hooks unless the hook is specifically about that effect, and document clearly when they occur.[5][2]
- Prefer simple, predictable naming: useFoo for hooks, PascalCase for components, clear prop names instead of abbreviations.[3][5]
- Co-locate tests, styles, and stories with their components to improve discoverability and refactoring.[14][2]

***

## TypeScript and safety

- Use TypeScript (or at least JSDoc types) for components, hooks, and utilities to catch errors at compile time and improve IDE help.[2][1]
- Prefer typed props and state over any/unknown; model domain concepts with discriminated unions instead of booleans when multiple states are possible.[14][2]
- Type external data at the boundary (e.g., API responses), and consider runtime validation for untrusted inputs.[10][2]

***

## JSX, styling, and DOM

- Keep JSX clean and readable; avoid deeply nested markup by extracting subcomponents.[3][1]
- Avoid putting complex logic directly in JSX; move it into variables or helper functions above the return.[6][3]
- Use semantic HTML tags and ARIA attributes; avoid div‑soup, especially for interactive elements.[5][2]
- Prefer CSS modules, utility CSS (like Tailwind), or well‑structured CSS‑in‑JS with attention to performance; avoid global styles that leak across features.[14][2]
- Use modern image optimizations (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats, or framework-level image components) for performance.[4][14]

***

## Side effects and lifecycle

- Use useEffect only for real side effects (subscriptions, event listeners, imperative APIs, syncing with non‑React systems), not for synchronous derivations that can be computed during render.[5][7]
- Carefully manage effect dependencies; prefer making effects idempotent and narrowing their scope instead of disabling lint rules.[7][6]
- Clean up subscriptions, timers, event listeners, and observers in the effect cleanup function to prevent leaks.[15][5]
- Avoid "fetch in every effect" anti‑pattern; centralize data fetching via libraries or well-designed hooks.[1][2]

***

## Error handling, boundaries, and UX

- Use Error Boundaries around major app sections (routes, dashboards, complex widgets) to avoid full app crashes.[2][1]
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for loading and error states (skeletons/spinners + retry, not just blank or generic messages).[4][1]
- Design for progressive enhancement: render useful content early and progressively hydrate/upgrade with client interactivity.[8][4]

***

## Testing and maintainability

- Write tests for critical flows (auth, payments, core workflows) using Jest/Vitest for unit tests and React Testing Library for behavior-focused component tests.[1][2]
- Use Cypress/Playwright (or similar) for end‑to‑end tests on key user journeys.[2][1]
- Favor testing behavior and user-visible outcomes rather than implementation details or specific hook calls.[6][2]
- Keep strict ESLint + Prettier (or equivalent) configs and ensure code always passes lint/format checks.[14][2]

***

## When instructing Claude (or another generator)

Provide instructions such as:

- "Use functional components and Hooks only; no class components."[1][2]
- "Keep components small and focused, and extract reusable pieces into separate components or hooks."[2][1]
- "Use React Query (or SWR) for data fetching, with clear handling of loading and error states."[4][1]
- "Optimize for performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders, use memoization wisely, use stable keys, and consider list virtualization."[7][1]
- "In RSC frameworks, default to Server Components for data fetching and keep Client Components minimal and interactive."[10][8]
- "Use TypeScript with strict, explicit types and keep JSX, effects, and state management clean, predictable, and well-tested."[14][2]

## Tailwind and CSS Best Practices

Use this as a checklist / rubric that Claude should adhere to when generating or refactoring Tailwind CSS and React code.

### 1. Project & Tailwind config

- Keep all Tailwind setup in `tailwind.config.(js|ts)` and a single main CSS entry (e.g. `src/index.css` or `src/global.css`). [1][2]
- Use the `content` option correctly so unused classes get purged. [3][4]
- Extend Tailwind instead of replacing it:
  - Add design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts, radii, breakpoints) under `theme.extend` to encode your design system. [3][4]
  - Prefer semantic tokens: e.g. `brand`, `accent`, `danger`, not raw hex names. [5][3]
- Enable/keep JIT (default in modern Tailwind) for on-demand class generation. [2]
- Use official plugins where useful (forms, typography, line-clamp, etc.). [4]

**Example:**
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          DEFAULT: "#0f766e",
          soft: "#ccfbf1",
        },
      },
      spacing: {
        128: "32rem",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/forms"), require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```

### 2. Utility-first mindset

- Prefer Tailwind utility classes co-located in JSX instead of separate CSS. [6][4]
- Start by styling at the component/page level, then extract into smaller components when patterns repeat. Avoid premature abstraction. [7][8]
- Let Tailwind's scales drive design (spacing, font sizes, colors) rather than arbitrary values; this keeps the UI consistent. [6][9]
- Use Tailwind's mobile-first responsive prefixes: `sm: md: lg: xl: 2xl:`. [1][10]
  - Example: `p-3 md:p-4 lg:p-6` for progressively larger padding. [1]

### 3. ClassName organization in React

- Keep className strings readable:
  - Group related utilities: layout → spacing → typography → decoration → state.
  - Put variants (hover:, focus:, sm:, dark:) next to the base class they modify. [1][10]
- For complex components, compose class names instead of giant literals:
  - Use helpers like `clsx` or `classnames`.
  - Use `tailwind-merge` (or `twMerge`) to resolve conflicting utilities. [11][12]
- Avoid passing raw Tailwind className fragments as many small props; prefer higher-level props like `variant`, `size`, `intent`, then map them to className internally. [7][8][4]

**Example:**
```tsx
const base =
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2";

const variants: Record<"primary" | "secondary", string> = {
  primary: "bg-brand text-white hover:bg-emerald-700",
  secondary: "bg-white text-gray-900 border border-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-50",
};

type ButtonProps = React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
};

export function Button({ variant = "primary", className, ...props }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={twMerge(base, variants[variant], className)}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

### 4. When (not) to use @apply or extra CSS

- Prefer pure utilities first; only introduce custom CSS when:
  - You repeat long utility chains across many components.
  - You need true pseudo-elements or complex selectors. [2][3]
- Use `@layer components` and `@apply` for shared component styles, but don't rebuild a BEM-style system—keep things minimal. [2][3]
- Avoid heavy use of `@apply` for variants like `hover:`/`focus:` if it hides what the component actually does. [5]

**Example (moderate use of @apply in a components layer):**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-brand text-white
      px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium shadow-sm hover:bg-emerald-700
      focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-brand focus:ring-offset-2;
  }
}
```

### 5. Component patterns with React + Tailwind

- Use composition + variants:
  - Simple primitive components (Button, Card, Input, Tag).
  - Map `variant`, `size`, and `state` props to Tailwind class maps. [7][8][4]
- Keep components small and focused; if JSX becomes too noisy, split into subcomponents instead of introducing global CSS. [7][13]
- For reusable layout primitives (Stack, Container, Grid), bake in sensible defaults (padding, max-width, gap) with Tailwind classes. [8][4]
- Treat Tailwind config + primitives as a lightweight design system. [5][4]

### 6. Responsive & state variants

- Follow a consistent order in className:
  - Base → responsive → state (hover, focus, active) → dark mode. [1][10]
- Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers instead of custom media queries in CSS whenever possible. [1][10]
- Use dark mode and prefers-reduced-motion via Tailwind's built-in variants if your app supports them. [10][2]

**Example:**
```tsx
<div className="
  flex flex-col gap-3
  sm:flex-row sm:items-center
  p-4 sm:p-6
  bg-white dark:bg-gray-900
  hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800
">
  ...
</div>
```

### 7. Accessibility & semantics

- Tailwind doesn't replace semantic HTML:
  - Use proper elements: `<button>`, `<a>`, `<label>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc. [2]
- Use focus styles, not `outline:none` without replacement.
  - Tailwind provides `focus:*` utilities, `focus-visible:*`, and ring utilities. [2]
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG; rely on your design tokens across the app, not ad hoc colors. [2][5]
- Use ARIA attributes and semantic roles where needed, same as with normal CSS. [2]

**Example:**
```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  className="
    inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full
    bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200
    text-gray-700
    focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-brand
  "
>
  ×
</button>
```

### 8. Performance & bundle size

- Ensure purge/content configuration covers all JSX/TSX files so unused classes are removed in production. [2][3][4]
- Avoid constructing class names dynamically with string concatenation that PurgeCSS cannot detect; use explicit class literals or known variant maps instead. [3][4]
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over huge custom CSS blocks; this keeps your final CSS small and tree-shake-friendly. [2][6]
- Keep global CSS minimal (resets, typography, a few component-level @apply rules) so Tailwind can do most of the heavy lifting. [2][3]

### 9. Folder structure & organization

- Example structure for React + Tailwind:
  ```
  src/
    components/
      ui/
        Button.tsx
        Input.tsx
        Card.tsx
      layout/
        Container.tsx
        Stack.tsx
    pages/ or routes/
    hooks/
    lib/
    styles/
      index.css   // Tailwind directives + small custom layers
  ```
- Keep design tokens in `tailwind.config` and reusable primitives in `components/ui`. [2][4][13]

### 10. Team conventions & code review

- Agree on conventions for:
  - Class order and formatting in JSX.
  - When to create a new component vs. reuse an existing one.
  - When `@apply` is allowed.
- In reviews, look for:
  - Repeated long class strings that should be components.
  - Usage of off-scale values (inline styles, arbitrary values) that break design consistency. [5][14]
  - Hard-coded colors instead of theme tokens. [5][3]

### 11. CSS fundamentals still matter

- Tailwind is just a utility API over normal CSS; understanding layout (flex, grid, position, overflow), typography, and cascade is still critical for debugging. [6][9]
- Use devtools to inspect final computed styles and ensure that Tailwind classes resolve the way you expect. [15][2]

### 12. Quick checklist for a new component

- Uses semantic HTML and accessible behaviors.
- Uses Tailwind scales (spacing, color, fontSize) instead of ad hoc values.
- Responsive behavior is handled via Tailwind breakpoints.
- Visual variants and sizes are mapped from props to Tailwind class maps.
- No obvious duplication of long class chains across the codebase.
- No unnecessary custom CSS where utilities would suffice.
