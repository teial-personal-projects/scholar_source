**Status:** ✅ Database configured and ready

---

## Part 2: Backend Deployment (Railway)

### 2.1 Prepare Backend for Deployment

1. [✅] **Create `railway.json files for Celery and backend` :**

1. Create railway.backend.json with contents:
```{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": { "builder": "RAILPACK" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port \"$PORT\" --log-level info"
  }
}```
2. Create railway.celery.json with contents.
```{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": { "builder": "RAILPACK" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python -u -m celery -A backend.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --queues=crew_jobs,default --concurrency=2 --max-tasks-per-child=50 --time-limit=1800 --soft-time-limit=1500 --pool=prefork"
  }
}``

2. **Update `pyproject.toml` to ensure all dependencies are listed:**

```toml
[project]
name = "scholar-source"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.13"

dependencies = [
    "crewai[tools]>=0.120.1,<1.0.0",
    "lancedb<0.26",
    "fastapi>=0.115.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.0",
    "python-multipart>=0.0.9",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    "supabase>=2.0.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
]
```
3. **Update `requirements.txt` for railway:**
Railway needed a requirements.txt so you have to run
```uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt```

4. **Update CORS origins in `backend/main.py`:**

```python
# Update to include your production frontend URL
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:5173",  # Development
        "https://https://scholar-source.pages.dev/",  # Cloudflare Pages (temp URL)
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### [✅] 2.2 Create Redis Database in Redis Cloud (Required for Scaling)
1. *[✅] *Sign up for Redis Cloud** (if not already done):
   - Go to https://redis.com/try-free/
   - Create account and verify email
   - Select "Fixed plan" → "Free" (30MB, perfect for getting started)

2. [✅] **Create Redis Database:**
   - Click "New database"
   - Name: `scholarsource-queue`
   - Region: Choose closest to your Railway deployment region
   - Click "Activate"

3. [✅] **Get Redis Connection URL:**
   - Go to database configuration
   - Copy the "Public endpoint" connection string
   - Format: `redis://default:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT`
   - **Save this URL** - you'll need it for Railway environment variables

### [✅] 2.3 Create Railway Deployment for Backend

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
5. Select your `scholar_source` repository

   NOTE: FREE VERSION ONLY LETS YOU GET 8MB MAX


### [✅] 2.7 Create Railway Celery Broker
1. Make sure Celery instance references REDIS_URL in celery_app.py
2. From Railway Dashboard, click on your project
3. Press the Create button
4. Select Github Repo as the template
5. Select the scholar_source repo
6. Go to Settings->Config-as-Code
7. Select the railway.celery.json file
10. Deploy changes

NOTE: YOU'LL NEED TO SET THE APPROPRIATE USER PRIVELGES FOR THE CONTAINER 
You will see this warning in the Railway celery log files. 
"SecurityWarning: You're running the worker with superuser privileges: this is
absolutely not recommended!"
For a small internal app, this warning is usually acceptable during development. To harden later, you would:
 1. Create a non‑root user in the image (or use a base image that does), and
 2. Start Celery with --uid / --gid for that user, or set the container user in your Dockerfile or service config.
​


### 2.8 Railway Environment Management

Railway supports multiple environments (production, development, staging) for managing different deployments.

#### Environment Detection

Railway automatically sets these environment variables:
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` - Environment name (production, development, etc.)
- `RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH` - Git branch deployed (main, develop, etc.)
- `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` - Full commit hash
- `RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME` - Service name (web, worker)
- `RAILWAY_PROJECT_NAME` - Project name

#### Setting Up Multiple Environments

**Method 1: Branch-Based (Recommended)**
- Production: Deploy from `main` branch → `production` environment
- Development: Deploy from `develop` branch → `development` environment

**Method 2: Manual Environment Creation**
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click "New Environment" (top right)
3. Name it (e.g., `staging`, `testing`)
4. Configure separate environment variables per environment

#### Environment-Specific Configuration

Set different variables per environment in Railway Dashboard:
- Select environment from dropdown (top-left)
- Go to Variables tab
- Add environment-specific values

**Example:**
- Production: `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`, `REDIS_URL=redis://prod-redis...`
- Development: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, `REDIS_URL=redis://dev-redis...`

#### Checking Current Environment

**In Railway Dashboard:**
- Look at top-left breadcrumb: `[Project] > [Environment] > [Service]`

**In Code:**
```python
import os
railway_env = os.getenv("RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME", "local")
logger.info(f"Running in {railway_env} environment")
```

**Via Railway CLI:**
```bash
railway status  # Shows current environment
railway environment production  # Switch to production
railway environment development  # Switch to development
```

### 2.9 Configure Scaling (Optional)

**Scale the Worker Process:**

By default, Railway runs 1 instance of each process. To scale:

1. Go to your service settings
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Under "Replicas", you can set:
   - **Horizontal scaling:** Number of instances (costs more)
   - **Vertical scaling:** CPU/Memory per instance

**Recommended Starter Configuration:**
- **Web instances:** 1 (scale up if API becomes slow)
- **Worker instances:** 1-2 (scale based on queue depth)
- **Memory:** 512MB - 1GB per instance
- **CPU:** Shared (upgrade to dedicated if needed)

**Auto-scaling (Pro plan):**
- Railway Pro supports auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- Configure min/max instances
- Automatically scales workers based on load

### 2.10 Verify Backend Deployment

1. Copy your Railway deployment URL (e.g., `https://scholarsource-dev.up.railway.app`)
2. Test the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://scholarsource-dev.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

3. **Submit Test Job:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://scholarsource-dev.up.railway.app/api/submit \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "course_name": "Test Course",
       "university_name": "Test University",
       "book_title": "Test Book",
       "book_author": "Test Author"
     }'
   ```
   Expected: Returns `job_id`

4. **Check Job Status:**
   ```bash
   curl https://scholarsource-dev.up.railway.app/api/status/{job_id}
   ```
   Expected: Returns job status (`queued`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed`)

5. **Monitor Worker Logs:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard → Deployments → Latest
   - Filter logs by `worker` process
   - You should see Celery processing the job

**Check Redis Connection:**

In Railway logs, verify:
- ✅ No Redis connection errors
- ✅ Worker successfully connected to Redis
- ✅ Tasks are being enqueued and consumed

**Status:** ✅ Backend deployed and running on Railway

## Part 10: Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

### 10.1 Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue 1: Worker Not Starting

**Symptoms:**
- Only see `web` process logs
- No Celery startup messages
- Jobs stay in `queued` status forever
- Worker exits immediately with no error

**Causes:**
- Procfile not detected or incorrect
- Worker process crashed during startup
- Missing dependencies
- Import errors
- PYTHONPATH not set correctly

**Fixes:**

1. **Verify Procfile exists and is correct:**
   ```bash
   web: uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --log-level info
   worker: bash scripts/railway_worker_start.sh
   ```

2. **Check Railway deployment logs:**
   - Go to Railway Dashboard → Deployments → Latest
   - Look for worker process startup messages
   - Check for import errors or missing modules

3. **Verify dependencies:**
   - Ensure `celery[redis]>=5.3.0` and `redis>=5.0.0` in `requirements.txt`
   - Check Railway build logs show successful installation

4. **Test imports locally:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from backend.celery_app import app; print('✅ OK')"
   python -c "from backend.tasks import run_crew_task; print('✅ OK')"
   ```

5. **Use enhanced startup script:**
   The project includes `scripts/railway_worker_start.sh` which:
   - Sets PYTHONPATH correctly
   - Tests imports before starting
   - Verifies Redis connection
   - Provides detailed logging

#### Issue 2: Redis Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
celery.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: CELERY_BROKER_URL is not set
```
or
```
redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error connecting to Redis
```

**Fixes:**
1. Verify `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set
2. Check Redis Cloud database is active
3. Verify Redis URL format: `redis://default:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT`
4. Check Redis Cloud firewall allows Railway IPs (usually not an issue)
5. Test Redis connection:
   ```bash
   railway run python -c "from redis import Redis; r=Redis.from_url('$REDIS_URL'); print(r.ping())"
   ```

#### Issue 3: Environment Variables Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Missing API keys errors
- Database connection failed
- Application crashes on startup

**Fixes:**
1. Go to Railway Variables tab
2. Verify all required variables are set
3. Check for typos in variable names
4. Redeploy after adding variables (click "Deploy" → "Redeploy")

#### Issue 4: Port Binding Error

**Symptoms:**
```
Error binding to 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Cause:**
- Using hardcoded port instead of `$PORT`

**Fix:**
- Procfile should use `$PORT`, not `8000`:
  ```
  web: uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```

#### Issue 5: Jobs Not Being Processed

**Symptoms:**
- Jobs stuck in `queued` status
- Worker logs show "ready" but no task execution
- Tasks not appearing in worker logs

**Fixes:**
1. **Check worker logs for errors:**
   - Railway Dashboard → Service Logs → Filter by `worker`
   - Look for task execution messages

2. **Verify queue names match:**
   - `backend/celery_app.py` defines queues (`crew_jobs`, `default`)
   - Procfile worker listens to correct queues: `--queues=crew_jobs,default`

3. **Check task registration:**
   ```python
   from backend.celery_app import app
   print(app.control.inspect().registered())  # Should show run_crew_task
   ```

4. **Manually test task:**
   ```python
   from backend.tasks import run_crew_task
   result = run_crew_task.delay("test-job-id", {"course_url": "https://example.com"})
   print(f"Task ID: {result.id}, Status: {result.status}")
   ```

5. **Verify worker is listening to correct queues:**
   ```python
   from backend.celery_app import app
   print(app.control.inspect().active_queues())  # Should show crew_jobs and default
   ```

#### Issue 6: Worker Dies Immediately

**Symptoms:**
- Worker starts but exits immediately
- No error messages in logs
- Process exits with code 1

**Fixes:**
1. **Check for syntax errors:**
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile backend/celery_app.py
   python -m py_compile backend/tasks.py
   ```

2. **Test imports:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import backend.celery_app"
   python -c "import backend.tasks"
   ```

3. **Check Railway build logs:**
   - Verify all dependencies installed successfully
   - Look for import errors during build

4. **Use startup script with diagnostics:**
   The `scripts/railway_worker_start.sh` script tests imports before starting

#### Issue 7: No Logs Visible

**Symptoms:**
- Worker process starts but produces no logs
- Cannot see what's happening

**Fixes:**
1. **Ensure unbuffered output:**
   - Use `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` in Procfile
   - Use `python -u` flag for unbuffered binary output
   - Use `--loglevel=info` or `--loglevel=debug`

2. **Check Railway log viewer:**
   - Go to Railway Dashboard → Service Logs (not just Deploy Logs)
   - Filter by `worker` process
   - Logs may take a few seconds to appear

3. **Verify logging configuration:**
   - Check `backend/logging_config.py` is configured correctly
   - Ensure handlers output to stdout/stderr

#### Issue 8: Pool/Concurrency Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Worker starts but tasks don't execute
- Worker hangs or becomes unresponsive
- High memory usage

**Fixes:**
1. **Use `solo` pool for Railway (recommended):**
   ```bash
   celery -A backend.celery_app worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info
   ```

2. **Adjust concurrency based on Railway plan:**
   - Hobby plan (512MB RAM): `--concurrency=1` or `--pool=solo`
   - Pro plan (8GB RAM): `--concurrency=2-4`

3. **Pool types:**
   - `solo` - Single process (best for Railway, recommended)
   - `prefork` - Multi-process (higher memory, default)
   - `threads` - Multi-threaded (lower memory)

### 10.2 Celery Worker Configuration

#### Recommended Worker Settings for Railway

**For Hobby Plan (512MB RAM):**
```bash
celery -A backend.celery_app worker \
  --pool=solo \
  --loglevel=info \
  --queues=crew_jobs,default \
  --max-tasks-per-child=50 \
  --time-limit=1800 \
  --soft-time-limit=1500
```

**For Pro Plan (8GB+ RAM):**
```bash
celery -A backend.celery_app worker \
  --pool=prefork \
  --concurrency=2 \
  --loglevel=info \
  --queues=crew_jobs,default \
  --max-tasks-per-child=50 \
  --time-limit=1800 \
  --soft-time-limit=1500
```

#### Worker Health Monitoring

The backend includes a worker health endpoint at `/api/health/workers`:

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health/workers
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "workers_available": true,
  "worker_count": 1,
  "workers": ["celery@hostname"]
}
```

### 10.3 Useful Railway CLI Commands

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# View logs (live)
railway logs

# View logs (worker only)
railway logs --filter worker

# Run command in Railway environment
railway run python scripts/test.py --redis

# SSH into Railway container (Pro plan)
railway shell
```

### 10.4 Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Monitoring Checklist

**Daily:**
- [ ] Check Railway dashboard for any crashed processes
- [ ] Monitor error rate in logs
- [ ] Check queue depth (jobs waiting to be processed)

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Review worker processing times
- [ ] Check Redis memory usage
- [ ] Monitor Railway resource usage (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Review cost dashboard

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Optimize worker count based on traffic patterns
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries
- [ ] Update dependencies (`pip list --outdated`)

#### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Queue Depth:** How many jobs waiting
   - Check Redis: `LLEN crew_jobs` command
   - Goal: Keep under 10-20 for good latency

2. **Worker Utilization:** Are workers busy or idle?
   - Check Celery logs for task start/complete messages
   - Scale up if workers constantly busy
   - Scale down if workers mostly idle

3. **Job Duration:** How long jobs take
   - Add logging in `backend/tasks.py`
   - Track P50, P95, P99 durations
   - Optimize slow jobs

4. **Error Rate:** Failed jobs
   - Monitor Railway logs for exceptions
   - Check job status distribution in database
   - Investigate and fix failed job patterns

### 10.5 Scaling Strategy

#### When to Scale UP (More Resources per Instance)

**Symptoms:**
- High CPU usage (>80% sustained)
- High memory usage (>80%)
- API response times increasing
- Worker tasks timing out

**Actions:**
1. Go to Railway Settings → Resources
2. Increase CPU/Memory allocation
3. Monitor performance improvement

#### When to Scale OUT (More Instances)

**Symptoms:**
- Queue depth consistently high (>20 jobs)
- API response time high despite low CPU
- Workers can't keep up with job submissions

**Actions:**

**Scale Workers:**
1. Go to Railway service settings
2. Increase replica count for worker process
3. Start with +1 worker, monitor queue depth
4. Continue scaling until queue depth is healthy

**Scale API:**
1. Less common to need multiple API instances initially
2. Scale when API CPU/memory is high
3. Ensure Redis-backed rate limiting is active
4. Railway will load balance across API instances

#### Cost-Effective Scaling Tips

1. **Scale workers first** - Usually the bottleneck
2. **Use autoscaling** (Pro plan) - Only pay for what you need
3. **Monitor queue depth** - Scale based on data, not guesses
4. **Optimize job duration** - Faster jobs = need fewer workers
5. **Use caching** - Reduce redundant work
6. **Schedule heavy tasks** - Run during off-peak hours if possible
