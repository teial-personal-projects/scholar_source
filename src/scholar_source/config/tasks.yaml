course_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze course page to extract textbook information, topics, and resource URLs.

    **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:**
    Extract textbook title and author from the course page - this is MANDATORY for downstream agents.

    **DEFINITION – OFFICIAL COURSE PAGE:**
    "Official course page" = a page whose primary content is the description,
    syllabus, or logistics of the specific course (title + number), not a
    department home page, news page, event listing, or general program overview.

    If a fetched page only contains department-wide info, news, events, conferences,
    or generic program descriptions and does not clearly describe the specific
    course (matching course_name and/or course_number), treat it as NOT the course
    page and keep searching.

    **WORKFLOW:**

    1. If course_name and university_name are provided (no URL):
       - Use web search to find the official course page URL.
       - Construct search queries that combine:
         - The exact course_name (including number if present), and
         - The university_name, and
         - Words like "course description", "class description", "syllabus",
           or "course catalog".
       - From the search results, collect several candidate URLs (top 5–10 results).
       - For each candidate, quickly check the title and snippet:
         - Prefer pages that:
           - Come from the university's own domains (e.g., *.edu or the
             university’s official domain), and
           - Include the course number or code in the URL path or page title, and
           - Mention "course description", "syllabus", "class description",
             "course catalog", or similar phrases.
         - Avoid selecting pages that are clearly department home pages, news pages,
           event listings, or general program pages (titles with only department
           names, "News", "Events", "Conference", etc.).
       - Choose the single best candidate as course_url before fetching the page.

    2. Check for user-provided textbook information:
       - If {book_title} and {book_author} are provided:
         - Use those as the primary textbook and set textbook_source="user_provided".
       - If {isbn} is provided:
         - Search for book info using the ISBN to confirm or fill missing metadata.
       - If {book_pdf_path} or {book_url} is provided:
         - Note these for downstream agents (they may use them as sources).
       - If {textbook} input is provided:
         - Parse it for title/author information and reconcile with any page data.

    3. Fetch course page content (if course_url is provided or found):
       - Use "Webpage Content Fetcher" on course_url.
       - FIRST, verify this is a true course page:
         - It should contain the course title and/or course number and a
           description or syllabus for this specific course.
         - If it only contains department-wide information, news, or conferences
           and no specific course details, treat it as NOT the course page and
           return to step 1 to search for a better URL (once).
       - Once a true course page is confirmed, search for textbook information in
         sections like:
         - "Materials", "Textbook", "Required Text", "Required Textbook",
           "Course Materials", "Resources".
       - Common textbook formats:
         - "Title, Author"
         - "Title by Author"
         - "Title (Author)"
         - Multi-line listing where title and author are on adjacent lines.
       - Parse into separate textbook_title and textbook_author fields.

    4. Extract syllabus (if present on course page):
       - Identify syllabus links (HTML or PDF), converting relative URLs to
         absolute URLs.
       - Fetch the syllabus ONCE using "Webpage Content Fetcher" (HTML or PDF).
       - Treat the syllabus as authoritative for textbook info and course scope.

    5. Determine topics (priority order):
       - If user provided topics_list → use as primary focus (user_specified_topics).
       - Extract topics from syllabus schedule/outline (shows actual course coverage).
       - Extract topics from course description and any listed learning objectives.
       - Cross-reference textbook table of contents (if available) with the syllabus
         to identify only the chapters/sections actually covered.
       - Be specific:
         - If the syllabus or page says "Chapters 3–7", map to the corresponding
           chapter titles, not every chapter in the book.

    6. Extract all resource URLs:
       - List all links to lecture notes, problem sets, exams, videos, and other
         course resources found on the course page and syllabus.
       - DO NOT navigate to these linked resources (prevents redirect loops).
       - These URLs will be used by downstream resource search and validation agents.

    **DEPTH RESTRICTION:**
    - Navigate ONLY to:
      - Main course page, and
      - Syllabus (if found).
    - Extract but do not navigate to other resource links.

    **ERROR HANDLING AND VALIDATION:**
    - If the course page is not accessible:
      - Halt with a clear message explaining the issue.
    - If no textbook is found on the course page or syllabus and no user-provided
      textbook information is available:
      - Set textbook_source="not_found" and continue with topic extraction.
    - If zero topics AND no textbook AND no description can be determined:
      - Return an error asking the user to provide topics_list or a textbook PDF/URL.
    - Validation:
      - At least one of (user_topics, general_course_topics, textbook_title)
        must exist in the final output.

    Inputs: {university_name}, {course_name}, {course_url}, {textbook}, {topics_list},
            {book_title}, {book_author}, {isbn}, {book_pdf_path}, {book_url},
            {desired_resource_types}, {targeted_sites}

resource_search_task:
  description: >
    Search for 5-7 high-quality resources from USA-based sources matching the course topics and user preferences.

    **WORKFLOW:**
    1. Parse user filters from inputs
    2. Determine search focus from course_analysis_task output
    3. Execute targeted searches (USA sources only)
    4. Filter and validate results (reject non-USA sources)
    5. Return curated list

    **USA-ONLY REQUIREMENT:**
    ALL resources must be from USA-based institutions, universities, or platforms.
    - Accept: MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, OpenStax, Khan Academy, US university sites
    - REJECT: Cambridge.ac.uk, Oxford.ac.uk, any non-US institution
    - When searching, include USA university names or add "USA" to queries
    - Verify domain and institution location before including any resource

    **USER FILTERS (APPLY AFTER USA CHECK):**
    
    Targeted Sites (if {targeted_sites} provided):
    - Parse as comma-separated domains (e.g., "stanford.edu, berkeley.edu")
    - Prioritize resources from these sites using "site:[domain]" in searches
    - Aim for 2-3 resources from targeted sites if quality matches
    
    Excluded Sites (if {excluded_sites} provided):
    - Parse as comma-separated domains (e.g., "mit, khanacademy.org")
    - REJECT any URL containing these strings (substring match)
    - This overrides all other filtering
    
    Resource Types (if {desired_resource_types} provided):
    - ONLY search for specified types:
      * "textbooks" → open_textbook
      * "practice_problem_sets" → practice_problem, problem_set
      * "practice_exams_tests" → practice_exam, test
      * "lecture_videos" → video_lecture, lecture_series, educational_video
    - If empty: use priority order (practice problems > textbooks > course materials > videos > papers)

    **TOPIC MATCHING:**
    From course_analysis_task output, check search_priority:
    - "user_topics" → Search ONLY user_specified_topics (e.g., "line integrals" not "vector calculus")
    - "general_topics" → Search general_course_topics
    - Always verify subject_keywords match to prevent cross-discipline results
    - REJECT resources from different academic fields

    **SEARCH EXECUTION:**
    Use "Search the internet with Serper" tool:
    - Pass ONLY a string to search_query parameter (e.g., "statics practice problems MIT")
    - DO NOT pass dictionaries or complex objects
    - Perform 5-7 targeted searches with simple string queries
    - Add "site:[domain]" for targeted sites
    - Include USA university names (e.g., "MIT", "Stanford", "Berkeley")

    **QUALITY CRITERIA:**
    - USA-based institutions and platforms ONLY (non-negotiable)
    - Free and legal access (no login required)
    - NotebookLM compatible (PDF/web/YouTube)
    - Match course level (from course_analysis_task)
    - Prioritize text-based content

    Inputs: {targeted_sites}, {excluded_sites}, {desired_resource_types}, course_analysis_task output

  expected_output: >
    List of 5-7 resources from USA sources only, each containing:
    
    - resource_title: Full title
    - resource_type: open_textbook | video_lecture | lecture_series | practice_problem | 
      course_notes | educational_video | problem_set | practice_exam
    - url: Direct link (accessible without login)
    - coverage_topics: List of topics this resource addresses
    - source_credibility: USA-based origin (e.g., "MIT OpenCourseWare", "OpenStax", "Khan Academy")
    - content_scope: comprehensive | supplementary | topic-specific
    - access_notes: Confirmation of free, legal, open access
    - estimated_depth: introductory | intermediate | advanced
    - alignment_with_book: How resource complements the course material
    - selection_rationale: Brief explanation of why included

    Format as structured JSON or clear text for downstream parsing.

  agent: resource_discovery_agent

resource_validation_task:
  description: >
    Validate resources from resource_discovery_agent for quality, legal, and technical requirements.

    **USER-EXCLUDED SITES (CRITICAL - FIRST CHECK):**
    Check the {excluded_sites} input parameter. If provided, REJECT any resource from domains in this list.
    - Parse excluded_sites as comma-separated domain names (e.g., "mit, khanacademy.org, coursera.org")
    - REJECT any URL containing ANY of these domain strings (substring match - e.g., "mit" will match "ocw.mit.edu", "mit.edu", etc.)
    - Examples: "mit" excludes "ocw.mit.edu", "khanacademy.org" excludes "www.khanacademy.org", "coursera" excludes "coursera.org"
    - Set rejection_reason to "User excluded domain: [domain]"
    - This is the FIRST validation check - do this before any other validation

    **CRITICAL - URL VALIDATION USING WEB SEARCH:**
    Before validating any resource, you MUST verify each URL actually exists and is accessible:
    1. For EVERY resource URL, perform a web search query: "[exact URL]" OR "site:[domain] [page title]"
    2. Check if the search results show the page exists and is accessible
    3. REJECT immediately if:
       - Search results show 404 errors or "page not found"
       - No search results found for the exact URL
       - Search results indicate the page was removed or moved
       - Domain doesn't exist or returns errors
    4. This prevents returning dead/broken links to users

    **CHECKS (EFFICIENT - MINIMIZE API CALLS):**
    1. URL format check: Verify URL structure (PDFs end in .pdf, YouTube URLs contain youtube.com, etc.)
    2. **URL ACCESSIBILITY (CRITICAL):** For web resources, verify the URL is actually valid:
       - Check for common 404 patterns and incomplete URLs
       - REJECT any URL that appears truncated or incomplete (e.g., ends abruptly without proper path)
       - LibreTexts URLs: Must be complete paths like "math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Calculus_(OpenStax)/[chapter]/[section]"
         * REJECT if URL ends with incomplete path like "/Calculus_(OpenStax" or "/Bookshelves/Calculus/Calculus_(OpenStax"
         * Must have full chapter and section path to be valid
       - OpenStax: Use URLs like "openstax.org/books/[book-name]" NOT "openstax.org/details/books/[book-name]"
       - MIT OCW: Verify URLs follow pattern "ocw.mit.edu/courses/[department]/[course-number]-[course-name]-[semester]-[year]/"
         * REJECT incomplete MIT OCW URLs that don't include full course path
       - Personal/Faculty PDFs: Be extra cautious - many faculty members remove old course materials
         * For URLs like "utsa.edu/kalra/..." or similar personal faculty pages, perform web search to verify still exists
         * REJECT if web search shows 404 or page not found
       - Udacity, Coursera, edX: REJECT ALL (require accounts)
       - If URL looks suspicious, incomplete, or uses an uncommon format, perform a quick web search to verify the correct URL
       - Reject resources with clearly broken, incomplete, or non-existent URLs
    3. **LOGIN/PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - AUTO-REJECT):**
       **Always reject these known platforms:**
       - Khan Academy (khanacademy.org): REJECT - requires login
       - Coursera (coursera.org): REJECT - requires account
       - Udemy (udemy.com): REJECT - paid
       - edX (edx.org): REJECT - requires account
       - Udacity (udacity.com): REJECT - requires account
       - Brilliant.org: REJECT - paid subscription
       - Course platforms (*.thinkific.com, *.teachable.com, *.podia.com): REJECT

       **URL pattern checks - reject if URL contains:**
       - "/premium/", "/pro/", "/subscription/", "/members-only/"
       - Any indication of paid/restricted content

       **General check for unknown platforms:**
       For resources from domains you're unsure about, perform a quick web search:
       - Search: "site:[domain] requires login" OR "site:[domain] free access"
       - If results indicate login/payment required → REJECT
       - If results show it's free and publicly accessible → APPROVE
    4. NotebookLM compatibility: Check format from URL extension and resource_type (PDF/web/YouTube)
    5. Source credibility: Verify from URL domain and source_credibility field (MIT OCW, OpenStax, etc.)
    6. **TOPIC RELEVANCE (CRITICAL):** Resource MUST match the course subject area
       - PRIMARY: Use resource_title, coverage_topics, and source_credibility from previous task to verify relevance
       - ONLY use WebsiteSearchTool if absolutely necessary (e.g., title is ambiguous) - LIMIT to 1-2 calls maximum
       - For PDFs: Verify from URL, title, and source - DO NOT use WebsiteSearchTool on PDFs
       - For YouTube: Verify from video title and channel - DO NOT use WebsiteSearchTool unless title is unclear
       - For web pages: Only use WebsiteSearchTool if title/topics don't clearly indicate relevance
       - For Vector Calculus course → REJECT probability, statistics, or unrelated math resources
       - For Renaissance History course → REJECT modern history, art history, or unrelated humanities resources
       - Most validation should be done from metadata already provided, not by making additional API calls

    **REMOVE:** Requires payment/login, pirated, broken links, low quality, incompatible, OR WRONG SUBJECT AREA.

    **SCORE:** Rate usefulness 1-10: relevance (40%), comprehensiveness (30%), credibility (20%), usability (10%).
    - Relevance score MUST be 0 if the resource is for a different academic field or discipline

    Use resources from previous task.

    4. Resources (organized by type/topic, with URLs, descriptions, topics covered)
    5. NotebookLM instructions (how to add PDFs/videos/web pages)
    6. Study tips (workflow, features)

    **FORMAT:** Clear headers, clickable URLs, bullet points, 2-4 pages. Tone: encouraging, clear, action-oriented.

    **CRITICAL:** Check the course_analysis_task output for textbook_title and textbook_author fields. If they exist, include them in the Textbook Information section. If they don't exist, state "No textbook information was found."

    Use validated resources and course analysis from previous tasks.
