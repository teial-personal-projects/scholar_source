course_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze course/book info to identify academic discipline and topics. CRITICAL: correctly identify field to prevent off-topic resources.

    **VALIDATION:** If course_url provided, use WebsiteSearchTool with website={course_url} and search_query="textbook syllabus course description" to access content. If book_url provided, use WebsiteSearchTool similarly. If neither accessible, return "ERROR: Cannot access provided resources."

    **EXTRACTION:**
    1. Course page: Use WebsiteSearchTool with website={course_url} and search_query="Textbook" or "Required Text" to find textbook info. Then search with search_query="Syllabus" or "Course Outline" for syllabus. Extract exact titles/authors/ISBNs.
    2. Textbook ToC: Search web for "[title] [author] table of contents" to get chapter topics.
    3. Topics: Combine from course page, syllabus, textbook ToC, or user topics_list (prioritize topics_list if provided).

    **ERROR IF:** Zero topics from all sources → "ERROR: Cannot determine course topics. Provide textbook PDF or topics list."

    **WEBSITESEARCHTOOL USAGE:** Call with website parameter set to the full URL (e.g., website="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/academics/courses/descriptions/GEN_ENG%20205-2.html") and search_query parameter set to what you're looking for (e.g., search_query="textbook").

    Inputs: {university_name}, {course_name}, {course_url}, {textbook}, {topics_list}, {book_title}, {book_author}, {isbn}, {book_pdf_path}, {book_url}, {desired_resource_types}
  expected_output: >
    A structured analysis containing:

    - course_title: The course name from the course page (e.g., "Engineering Analysis: Statics")
    - course_number: The course number (e.g., "GEN_ENG 205-2")
    - official_textbooks: Textbook title, author, edition, ISBN if found on course page
    - syllabus_url: URL to syllabus if found on course page
    - topics: Comprehensive list of ALL topics from textbook ToC, syllabus, course page, or user input
      (e.g., ["Vectors", "Forces", "Systems of Forces and Moments", "Equilibrium", "Structures",
      "Centroids", "Centers of Mass", "Moments of Inertia", "Friction", "Internal Forces", "Virtual Work"])
    - course_level: "introductory" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | "professional"
    - textbook_source: Where textbook info came from ("course_page", "user_provided", "not_found")
    - subject_keywords: List of keywords describing the subject based on topics (e.g., ["statics", "mechanics", "forces", "equilibrium"])

    Format as a clean JSON object or structured text that subsequent agents can easily parse.

resource_search_task:
  description: >
    Search for 5-7 high-quality resources from USA-based institutions matching the course topics.

    **TOPIC MATCHING:** Use topics and subject_keywords from course_analysis_task. Search queries must include these terms.

    **USA ONLY:** Only include resources from US universities, institutions, and platforms.

    **RESOURCE TYPE FILTERING:** Check {desired_resource_types} input.
    - If provided (non-empty list), ONLY search for matching types:
      * "textbooks" → resource_type="open_textbook"
      * "practice_problem_sets" → resource_type="practice_problem" or "problem_set"
      * "practice_exams_tests" → resource_type="practice_exam" or "test"
      * "lecture_videos" → resource_type="video_lecture" or "lecture_series" or "educational_video"
    - If empty/null, use priority order: (1) Practice problems, (2) Open textbooks, (3) Course materials, (4) Platform content, (5) Papers

    **SEARCH TOOL:** Use "Search the internet with Serper" with simple string queries like "statics practice problems MIT". Perform 5-7 targeted searches.

    **QUALITY:** Free, legal, US sources only. NotebookLM compatible (PDF/web/YouTube). Prioritize text-based content. Match course level.

    Use course_analysis_task output to guide searches.
